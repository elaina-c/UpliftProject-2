              <h2>Searching for a Start</h2>
              <p>
                At first, I didn‚Äôt know what to build for our second web
                project. I love anime, but working with APIs felt scary. I
                didn‚Äôt understand how they worked. I tried following tutorials
                and guides, but they just confused me more. That‚Äôs when I
                realized: I can‚Äôt understand something big without learning the
                basics first. So, I went back to JavaScript fundamentals. I
                reviewed
                <code>async</code>, <code>await</code>, and watched videos from
                our Moodle and YouTube. I wasn‚Äôt done with all the activities,
                but I finally <em>understood enough</em> to begin.

            <div class="story-text-container">
              <h2>From Confusion to Clarity</h2>
              <p>
                I struggled so hard just to find the right API. I looked at some
                sites, even GitHub links, but most of them were hard to
                understand. Some were broken. Others were for Pok√©mon or things
                I didn‚Äôt care about. But then... I found the
                <strong>Jikan API</strong>. An anime API. I clicked it, explored
                it, and thought: <em>‚ÄúThis is it.‚Äù</em> Finally, I found
                something I connected with. It made everything more exciting.

              <h2>Building My App</h2>
              <p>
                I started by building the HTML structure and connecting the
                JavaScript file. I added a search bar, and my first goal was
                just to get the anime data to appear in the console. It worked!
                Then came the CSS ‚Äî just enough to move my anime results out of
                the console and into the actual webpage. That moment when I saw
                the anime images <em>on the screen</em>? I was so proud.

              <h2>Dealing with Errors & Feeling Stuck</h2>
              <p>
                I saw so many console errors. Some were about limits, others
                were bugs I didn‚Äôt even understand. I didn‚Äôt know whether to fix
                them now or later. I was overwhelmed. But I remembered how
                indecisive I was during our first project. So this time, I told
                myself:
                <em>Focus on functionality first. Fix the errors later.</em>
                That mindset helped me push through.

            <div class="story-text-container">
              <h2>Random Button & Input Features</h2>
              <p>
                I added a feature where you could search any anime ‚Äî even by
                just typing the first letter. If nothing is typed, it shows a
                random list of anime. I also added features like hitting ‚ÄúEnter‚Äù
                to search, and the input auto-focuses when the page loads. I
                reused some code from our number guessing game (shoutout to my
                notes!).

              <h2>From Design Anxiety to Animation Delight</h2>
              <p>
                In my first project, I focused too much on design and forgot
                functionality. So now, I did the opposite: functionality first,
                design later. But when it was time to design... I froze again. I
                spent <strong>2 hours and 30 minutes</strong> just choosing one
                photo. I was that indecisive. I was inspired by
                <strong>Ai from Oshi no Ko</strong> (yes, the character who died
                in Ep 1 I cried). I designed a banner with her beautiful and
                death face on opposite sides and titled my app:
                <em>‚ÄúAi Love Anime.‚Äù</em> (Get it? ‚ÄúI love anime‚Äù üòÜ).

              <h2>Letting Go of the Movie Feature</h2>
              <p>
                I wanted to include movies too. I even had ideas for using
                Genshin characters like Xiao and Kinu in different nav sections.
                But time was running out, and the more I added, the more I
                struggled. So I dropped the movie idea. And I‚Äôm glad I did. The
                anime browser itself was enough. It works. It‚Äôs functional. And
                I can always expand it later.

              <h2>Making It Mobile-Ready</h2>
              <p>
                I tested the app on desktop, tablet, and phone. It was hard to
                make the images fit, especially when they looked squished or
                uneven. But I kept adjusting. Now, it looks good across all
                devices ‚Äî though the card alignment still bothers me a little.
                I‚Äôll fix it soon.

              <h2>The Final Touches</h2>
              <p>
                I added a description box so users know what the website is
                about. I included cute jumping characters to give it life. The
                colors? Pink and violet ‚Äî my favorite combo. And even though I
                was tired, burned out, and sick of picking designs... I was
                proud. I learned so much. From not knowing what an API was, to
                building something real. Something mine.

              <h2>What I Learned</h2>
              <p>
                This project taught me more than just code. It taught me
                patience. That errors don‚Äôt mean failure. That being indecisive
                is okay, as long as you keep going. I spent 6 to 22 hours a day
                building this. I forgot how I even did some of it. But I‚Äôm
                proud. And even if I don‚Äôt get everything perfect, I know one
                thing:
                <em>I built an anime browser app. I did it.</em> Thank you for
                reading.
